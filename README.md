IE-CodeChallenge

This is an attempt of a PACMAN Simulator, for the IE Code Challenge. I decided to build the application using NodeJS. 

1. To run the simulator, go to the root directory of this project and run npm install in command prompt.

2. Once packages have installed, run the simulator by running:
      node pacman.js
3. Update the commands.txt for different variations of commands for pacman.
      
4. Example command list are the following:
      - PLACE 0,0,NORTH MOVE MOVE RIGHT MOVE MOVE LEFT MOVE RIGHT MOVE RIGHT MOVE MOVE LEFT REPORT 
      - PLACE 5,5,SOUTH MOVE MOVE RIGHT MOVE MOVE LEFT MOVE REPORT PLACE 0,0,NORTH REPORT
